Purpose: The Ghostly Hunting Simulator v1.00001 is A CUGHS certified program that is the apex of CUGHS Technology so far! All you need to do is enter the names of your hunters, and you can watch as a simulation of your hunt unfolds*(1)! For now, there is only one building that you can simulate, but in future updates we plan to allow you to create buildings of your own, as well as control the simulation to an extent*(2). For now, you'd have to do that yourself manually in the populate building function. There's truly a lot to explore, and I hope you have a good time exploring it!

Source Files: building.c, room.c, ghost.c, hunter.c, evidence.c, helper.c, main.c. defs.h

How to Operate:
	1: Type 'make' into the terminal where the program is located
		*Note: Make sure you're in the directory before compiling!!
	2: Type './ghostHunter' into the terminal in order to run the program
	3: You will be asked to input the names of the hunters, so please do so and hit enter when you are done
	4: After you are done, you will see the simulation unfold! Hope you can keep up with the data!
	5: Sit back and relax! Let the simulation do the work for you!
	6: At the end, you will see who has won, the ghost or the hunters (Spoiler Alert, Ghosts are very tricky to pin down so don't worry if your hunters lose the first couple of simulations!)
	7: If you wish to learn more about the inner workings of the program, do not hesitate to check out the code and the documentation within.
	
Once again, it brings us great joy to assist in investigating those ghosts. We may soon no longer be a part of the CUGHS crew, but we will forever be a part of the CUGHS soul! So stay safe out there and have fun!

*(1) Simulation results may not accurately match actual ghost hunting results. Your experience may vary.
*(2) These updates may or may not happen in the future, and are at the discretion of the CUGHS Technical Crew

We have also accomplished some of the secret missions for extra points:
    - We used version control to ensure we would never lose our progress (as seen in git.png)
